# Tips for Wiki Pages

## Notice Boxes

Notice boxes are an easy way to highlight important information in GitHub Flavored Markdown, using syntax like:
```md
> [!NOTE]  
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]
> Negative potential consequences of an action.
```

While Nextra does not support notice boxes directly, they provide an analogous feature called Callouts. We have a standard format for how callout boxes should be written.

First, it is necessary to import the component at the top of any page that uses Callouts:
```mdx
import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'
```

Now, you can use the following templates:
#### Note Box
<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
</Callout>
```mdx
<Callout type="info" emoji="✎">
  **Note:** Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
</Callout>
```

#### Important Box
<Callout emoji="ⓘ">
  **Important:** Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.
</Callout>
```mdx
<Callout emoji="ⓘ">
  **Important:** Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.
</Callout>
```

#### Warning Box
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  **Warning:** Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
</Callout>
```mdx
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠">
  **Warning:** Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
</Callout>
```

#### Danger Box
<Callout type="error" emoji="⛌">
  **Danger:** Negative potential consequences of an action.
</Callout>
```mdx
<Callout type="error" emoji="⛌">
  **Danger:** Negative potential consequences of an action.
</Callout>
```
