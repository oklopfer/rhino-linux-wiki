# Packaging UBXI

### Reference

Before proceeding, please make sure you have followed our [creation/development guide](create).

While the details of the implementation of a UBXI DE are directly tied to its base DE, the pacscript for [unicorn-desktop-git](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs/blob/master/packages/unicorn-desktop-git/unicorn-desktop-git.pacscript) should be used as a reference for UBXI packages. The full pacscript packaging guide can be found [here](../pacstall-101).

### Dotfiles

All of the dotfiles needed for the configuration of a UBXI DE must be placed in a git source repository, preferably on GitHub or GitLab, similar to how the [Unicorn repository](https://github.com/rhino-linux/unicorn) is structured.

### Packaging Standards

All UBXI packages must follow the UBXI naming convention:  
`ubxi-{environment}-{platform}-git`, where:

- `environment` is the DE/WM base, such as: `gnome`, `phosh`, `kde`, `awesomewm`, etc.
- `platform` is either `desktop` or `mobile`.

Additionally, all UBXI packages **must** include `rhino-ubxi-core` as a `pacdep`.

All UBXI packages are to be submitted to [the pacstall-programs repository](https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall-programs) for testing and review by both the Pacstall and Rhino Linux teams before approval.
