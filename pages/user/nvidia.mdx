# Install Nvidia Drivers

Nvidia driver installation on Rhino Linux is fairly straightforward. To install Nvidia drivers, just run the following command:
```bash
rhino-pkg install nvidia-dkms
```

This will list multiple version options to install. If you do not know which one will work best for you, check [Nvidia's website](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx).

On some older laptops, you may also need Primus libraries.
```bash
rhino-pkg install primus-nvidia
```
