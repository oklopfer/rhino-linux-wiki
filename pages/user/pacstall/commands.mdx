### Commands

#### `-h`, `--help`
Show the help message and exit.

#### `-I`, `--install`
Installs a given package from a repository, or a pacscript. The `-I` flag has the ability to install packages from the following repository providers: `github:`, `gitlab:`, `sourcehut:`, `codeberg:`. Other git providers may use a direct link. These must be added beforehand to the repository list with `-A/--add-repo`. If multiple repositories are enabled, `pacstall` will default to `pacstall/pacstall-programs`, but you can still choose to install from another repository. You can also specify a local pacscript by including the `.pacscript` suffix. The following are valid examples of the `-I` flag:

```bash
$ pacstall -I neofetch  # Install neofetch

$ pacstall -I "alacritty@github:user/reponame"  # Install alacritty from https://github.com/user/reponame

$ pacstall -I "alacritty@https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/reponame/master"  # Install alacritty from the raw link

$ pacstall -I "alacritty@myrepo"  # Install alacritty from the @myrepo alias

$ pacstall -I neofetch.pacscript  # Install neofetch from local pacscript

$ pacstall -I ${parent}:pkgbase  # Install all pkgnames in the pkgbase named parent

$ pacstall -I ${parent}:${child}  # Install only the pkgname child from the pkgbase parent

$ pacstall -I package.pacscript:${child}  # Install only the pkgname child from a local split package
```

#### `-R`, `--remove`
Removes a given package from the system. For example:

```bash
$ pacstall -R neofetch
```

#### `-S`, `--search`
Searches for a given package from all available repositories. A clickable hyperlink to the repositories containing the packages is displayed in VTE terminals. Other repositories can be added using the `-A` flag. To search in a specific repository, use the `@` separator.

```bash
$ pacstall -S -git  # search for all git packages

$ pacstall -S "-bin@github:user/reponame"  # search for all binary packages from https://github.com/user/reponame
```

#### `-Sd`, `--search-description`
Like search, but both displays descriptions on output, and searches through descriptions upon the query. To do a case-sensitive search, use quotes within quotes (`"''"` or `'""'`).

```bash
$ pacstall -Sd browser  # search for all packages which have browser in their name or description

$ pacstall -Sd "'Browser'"  # search for all packages which have Browser in their description
```

#### `-Si`, `--search-info`
Display metadata (SRCINFO) of a remote package. Only accepts real package names.

```bash
$ pacstall -Si neofetch  # Search neofetch info

$ pacstall -Si "alacritty@github:user/reponame"  # Search alacritty info from https://github.com/user/reponame

$ pacstall -Si "alacritty@https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/reponame/master"  # Search alacritty info from the raw link

$ pacstall -Si ${parent}:pkgbase  # Search all pkgnames in the pkgbase named parent

$ pacstall -Si ${parent}:${child}  # Search only the pkgname child from the pkgbase parent
```

#### `-A`, `--add-repo`
Add a given repository to `pacstall`. If a plain GitHub or GitLab link is given without a branch, `pacstall` will default to `master`, but you can specify a branch. Local repositories are also supported, which can be useful for testing pacscripts without pushing remotely, having a portable repository on a USB stick, custom/private applications, etc. Additionally, an alias can optionally be linked to an added repository, so that it is easier to search and install from. See [here](files#pacstallrepo) for information on how this is stored.

The following commands are valid ways to add a repository:

```bash
$ pacstall -A https://github.com/user/repo

$ pacstall -A https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch

$ pacstall -A github:user/repo

$ pacstall -A github:user/repo#branch

$ pacstall -A github:user/repo @alias

$ pacstall -A https://gitlab.com/user/repo

$ pacstall -A https://gitlab.com/user/repo/-/tree/branch

$ pacstall -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/master

$ pacstall -A https://gitlab.com/user/repo/-/raw/master @myrepo

$ pacstall -A gitlab:user/repo

$ pacstall -A gitlab:user/repo#branch

$ pacstall -A sourcehut:user/repo

$ pacstall -A sourcehut:user/repo#branch

$ pacstall -A codeberg:user/repo

$ pacstall -A codeberg:user/repo#branch

$ pacstall -A file:///home/user/local-repository

$ pacstall -A /home/user/local-repository

$ pacstall -A local:/home/user/local-repository

$ pacstall -A https://myonlinerepository.com/directory_containing_packagelist @myrepo
```

#### `-Rr`, `--remove-repo`
Remove a given repository from `pacstall`. See `-A`, `--add-repo` for syntax usage, swapping `-A` with `-Rr`. Passing just an alias can also prompt it to be removed:

```bash
$ pacstall -Rr @myrepo
```

#### `-U`, `--update`
Updates `pacstall` and needed scripts. Arguments to this flag are as follows: The first flag is the username, while the second flag is the branch. The second argument is optional as long as the first argument is given; however, both the first and second arguments are optional together. If no argument for the branch is given, it will default to `master`. See [here](files#update) for information on how this is stored.

When updating to a specific repository, the arguments used will be saved so that the next time the `-U` flag is used, if no arguments are given, `pacstall` will update through the same user and branch. If there is a typo in the username or branch, `pacstall` will not update, and your current state will not be touched. You may also replace the username and branch arguments with a `.` to update from a local Pacstall repository.

The following are valid examples:

```bash
$ pacstall -U pacstall develop  # This will update pacstall from https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall/tree/develop

$ pacstall -U pacstall:develop  # This will update pacstall from https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall/tree/develop

$ pacstall -U  # This will update pacstall from https://github.com/pacstall/pacstall/tree/develop, because the previous arguments were saved

$ pacstall -U user  # This will update pacstall from https://github.com/user/pacstall/tree/master

$ pacstall -U .  # This will update pacstall from a local Pacstall repository
```

#### `-Up`, `--upgrade`
Upgrade packages that have a newer version.

#### `-L`, `--list`
List installed packages.

#### `-T`, `--tree`
Display a tree graph of a package.

#### `-V`, `--version`
Lists `pacstall` version and name.

#### `-D`, `--download`
Download pacscript to the current directory. You can specify an arbitrary repository like so:

```bash
$ pacstall -D neofetch@github:user/reponame  # This downloads the neofetch pacscript from https://github.com/user/reponame
```

#### `-Ci`, `--cache-info`
Display metadata of an installed package. Supply a key from the output to get its value, or no key to get all values. If a key has spaces in it, replace them with an underscore. For example:

```bash
$ pacstall -Ci neofetch install_type

$ pacstall -Ci alacritty
```

#### `-Qa`, `--quality-assurance`
Test a package from a PR downstream before it is merged. Used like:

```bash
$ pacstall -Qa firefox-bin#5853

$ pacstall -Qa firefox-bin#5853@github:pacstall/pacstall-programs

$ pacstall -Qa firefox-bin@github:pacstall/pacstall-programs#5853
```

Where the `package` is given first, followed by the pull request `NUM`, separated by a `#`. Optionally, a `metalink` separated by a `@` may be provided before or after the `#NUM`. The `metalink` is broken down into three parts: `provider`, `owner`, and `repo`. The `owner` should be the owner of the repository the PR is being merged into, *not* the user who created the PR. No other flags should be provided to this command.

### Options

#### `-P`, `--disable-prompts`
Add this flag alongside other commands to disable prompts and accept all defaults. For example:

```bash
$ pacstall -PR neofetch
```

#### `-K`, `--keep`
Add this flag alongside `-I` and `-Up` to keep the build of a package if the build process fails or succeeds.

#### `-B`, `--build-only`
Add this flag alongside `-I` and `-Up` to just build the deb, and not install.

#### `-Q`, `--quiet`
Add this flag alongside `-I` and `-Up` to silence downloading.

#### `-Nc`, `--nocheck`
Add this flag alongside `-I` and `-Up` to skip the check() function when building.

#### `-Ns`, `--nosandbox`
Add this flag alongside `-I` and `-Up` to build without `bwrap`. This flag should be used with caution, and can lead to potential unwanted harm on a system. It is intended for use in environments such as `chroot`, which have other levels of isolation.


### Environment

#### `DISABLE_PROMPTS`
Equivalent of the `-P` flag.

#### `PACSTALL_SUPPRESS_SOLUTIONS`
Set this to remove suggestions given by Pacstall to fix problems.

#### `PACSTALL_BUILD_CORES`
Set this to an integer to override the `nproc` command and `${NCPU}` variable in any Pacscript.

#### `PACSTALL_EDITOR`
Sets the editor used by Pacstall.

#### `PACSTALL_DOWNLOADER`
Sets the downloading tool used. Can be set to `axel`, `wget`, `quiet-wget`, or `curl`.

#### `PACSTALL_PAYLOAD`
Sets the path to a pre-downloaded package archive. Provide multiple paths in a single string by separating with `;:`.

#### `NO_COLOR`
Turns off all colors.
