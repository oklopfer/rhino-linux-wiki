# Pacstall
### The AUR for Ubuntu

***Why is this any different than any other package manager?***

Pacstall uses the stable base of Ubuntu but allows you to use bleeding edge software with little to no compromises, so you don't have to worry about security patches or new features.

***How does it work then?***

Pacstall takes in files known as pacscripts (similar to PKGBUILDs) that contain the necessary contents to build packages, and builds them into executables on your system.
